            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>They met at church, where my papa was drawn to Mama because of her height. After a brief conversation, he asked for her name and address. He was accompanied by his friend, who happens to be my motherâ€™s cousin. He presented her with roses, and they began courting. Almost six months later, they officially entered into a relationship, and six years after that, they got married.</p>
            <p>On March 30, 2004, I was born as the second child in my family. My family was overjoyed because I was a cute baby. My early years were filled with happiness and excitement, captured in pictures with both sides of my family. I celebrated my birthdays surrounded by loved ones.</p>
            <p>During grade school, my parents and teachers took pride in all my achievements. I learned quickly and consistently ranked at the top of my class. High school brought new adventures as I made friends who are still important to me today. But, senior high school presented challenges, I found myself without friends in the same academic strand. It was tough at first, but I learned to adjust day by day.</p>
            <p>And as my first and second-year college student life, I find myself facing similar experiences. I'm adapting as our country returns to normalcy and we resume face-to-face classes. It's exciting to meet new people and dive deeper into my studies. I've also joined different organizations that have given me knowledge and skills, allowing me to grow both personally and academically. I envision myself as an IT professional in the future, determined to share my achievements and diploma with my parents. One day, I hope to have my own house and spoil them with everything they desire.</p>
